# Mini-apps

This application is a collection of mini-applications in which I implement different logic and learn to use different dependencies.

At the moment, the application has a dice roll and quizzes. The application will improve when I learn new interesting skills and want to add new mini apps.


I used the following dependencies:

- google_fonts - to simple using differents fonts
- audioplayers - to play music in apps
